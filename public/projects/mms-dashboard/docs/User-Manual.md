## 2. Main Dashboard

Use the main dashboard to check current production condition.

- Machine status: running, stop, alarm, maintenance, or other configured states.
- Output and target: compares actual production against plan.
- OEE: combines availability, performance, and quality.
- NG: shows reject quantity and quality impact.

## 3. Daily Report

1. Open the Daily Dashboard page.
2. Select date, area, type, and machine filter.
3. Review output target per day, actual output, OEE, downtime, and alarm summary.
4. Use the report to identify which machine or type lost output during the selected day.

## 4. Monthly Report

1. Open the Monthly Dashboard page.
2. Select month range and filter.
3. Review month-by-month output and OEE trend.
4. Compare monthly performance before and after improvement actions.

## 5. Production Plan and Target

1. Open production plan or output target configuration.
2. Select machine and date range.
3. Enter target output, cycle time target, efficiency target, model, process, and working hours.
4. Save the plan.
5. Reopen dashboard/report pages to verify the target is applied.

## 6. OEE Update and NG Flow

1. Open the OEE update page.
2. Select machine and date.
3. Review actual output and NG quantity.
4. Enter or update manual NG if required.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard has no data | Check backend PM2 status, SQL Server connection, and `DATABASE_URL` |
| Machine status not updating | Check MQTT broker, InfluxDB, machine network, and worker logs |
| Frontend cannot call API | Check backend port, reverse proxy, CORS, and frontend `apiServer` config |
| PM2 process restarts | Check `backend/logs/pm2-error.log` and memory usage |
| Report number looks wrong | Check target plan, machine filter, date range, and source table consistency |
